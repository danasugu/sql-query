Basics
USE sql_store;
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE state = ‘CA’
ORDER BY first_name
LIMIT 3;
• SQL is not a case-sensitive language.
• In MySQL, every statement must be terminated with a semicolon.
Comments
We use comments to add notes to our code.
—- This is a comment and it won’t get executed.
SELECT Clause
—- Using expressions
SELECT (points * 10 + 20) AS discount_factor
FROM customers
Order of operations:
• Parenthesis
• Multiplication / division
• Addition / subtraction
—- Removing duplicates
SELECT DISTINCT state
FROM customers 
WHERE Clause
We use the WHERE clause to filter data.
Comparison operators:
• Greater than: >
• Greater than or equal to: >=
• Less than: <
• Less than or equal to: <=
• Equal: =
• Not equal: <>
• Not equal: !=
Logical Operators
—- AND (both conditions must be True)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birthdate > ‘1990-01-01’ AND points > 1000
—- OR (at least one condition must be True)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE birthdate > ‘1990-01-01’ OR points > 1000
—- NOT (to negate a condition)
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE NOT (birthdate > ‘1990-01-01’)
IN Operator
—- Returns customers in any of these states: VA, NY, CA
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE state IN (‘VA’, ‘NY’, ‘CA’)
BETWEEN Operator
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE points BETWEEN 100 AND 200
LIKE Operator
—- Returns customers whose first name starts with b
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name LIKE ‘b%’
• %: any number of characters
• _: exactly one character
REGEXP Operator
—- Returns customers whose first name starts with a
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE first_name REGEXP ‘^a’
• ^: beginning of a string
• $: end of a string
• |: logical OR
• [abc]: match any single characters
• [a-d]: any characters from a to d 
More Examples
—- Returns customers whose first name ends with EY or ON
WHERE first_name REGEXP ‘ey$|on$’
—- Returns customers whose first name starts with MY
—- or contains SE
WHERE first_name REGEXP ‘^my|se’
—- Returns customers whose first name contains B followed by
—- R or U
WHERE first_name REGEXP ‘b[ru]’
IS NULL Operator
—- Returns customers who don’t have a phone number
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE phone IS NULL
ORDER BY Clause
—- Sort customers by state (in ascending order), and then
—- by their first name (in descending order)
SELECT *
FROM customers
ORDER BY state, first_name DESC
LIMIT Clause
—- Return only 3 customers
SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 3
—- Skip 6 customers and return 3
SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 6, 3
Inner Joins
SELECT *
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o
 ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
Outer Joins
—- Return all customers whether they have any orders or not
SELECT *
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
 ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
USING Clause
If column names are exactly the same, you can simplify the join with the USING
clause.
SELECT *
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o
 USING (customer_id)
Cross Joins
—- Combine every color with every size
SELECT *
FROM colors
CROSS JOIN sizes
Unions
—- Combine records from multiple result sets
SELECT name, address
FROM customers
UNION
SELECT name, address
FROM clients
Inserting Data
—- Insert a single record
INSERT INTO customers(first_name, phone, points)
VALUES (‘Mosh’, NULL, DEFAULT)
—- Insert multiple single records
INSERT INTO customers(first_name, phone, points)
VALUES
 (‘Mosh’, NULL, DEFAULT),
 (‘Bob’, ‘1234’, 10)
